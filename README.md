# Good Ole' Days
This is our project for SteelHacks in Fall 2025!

## Our Mission
We set out to create an app focused on helping seniors find suitable places to live. We took into account various factors like proximity to healthcare and entertainment, price, and number of floors.

## The Team
Our team consisted of [Bhavana](https://github.com/bhavana-pixel), [Danny](https://github.com/dannylawler), [Joe](https://github.com/joe-magg), and [Shane](https://github.com/shane-thoma). Bhavana and Danny were the main frontend developers for the project, working to perfect the user experience for our target audience. Joe and Shane were the main backend developers for the project, using machine learning to determine the best places to recommend.
