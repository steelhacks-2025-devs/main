# Scraping Land Parcels

Before discovering the dataset that gave us over 90,000 houses, I tried scraping land parcels in specific neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. After running the async scraper featured in this program (modified the code from a project where I made 100-200 requests/sec), I realized that with the land API's rate-limits that it would take over a year to scrape all of Pittsburgh.
